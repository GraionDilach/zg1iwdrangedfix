## Attempt to fix IWDification random ranged weapons

This mod is a workaround to fix a compatibility layer between IWDification versions introducing randomization on weapons based on weapon categories and SCS v34, which detects this logic as a melee weapon and takes away the ranged AI from the monsters affected.

Just install this mod between the two aforementioned one, after IWDification, but before SCS.
